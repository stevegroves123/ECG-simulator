# ECG-simulator
Very basic ecg simulator

in 1988 I created a 3 lead ecg simulator out of a 555 timer and a 4017B Johnson 10 stage counter, it lasted for 20 years before I rediscovered it and laughed, then threw it in the bin.

I've now decided to recreate this using a microcontroller with analogue out, but this time it will have an OLED display and more than one mode. I'm going to use the Xiao SAM by Seeeed (never sure how many 'e' to use) as it's small and I have a few in the draw.
