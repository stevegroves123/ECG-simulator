This is the test area for the project.

The initial uploads are test files to see if the ideas work. The output (qrs) is sent via A0 (the DAC) and to test it is recieved at A2.

The array that holds the qrs shape is used to create the OLED waveform, not sure if this is a good idea or not, but trying it for now.
